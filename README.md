# Statistical Pattern Recognition exercises 

This code repository contains the exercises for the
[Statistical Pattern recognition Course](https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/lectures/spr/).

Exercise and solutions will be in jupyter notebook format and will be made available
in a delayed basis.
The `data` directory contains small datasets that your will need for different excercies.

## Setup

Follow [setup.pdf](setup.pdf). Afterwards you should have a working miniconda installation,
a python environment with the installed requirements and a clone of this exercise repository.
All commands assume you run them from the root of the repository folder unless otherwise stated.

Get familiar with [jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/),
start a local jupyter lab server with the `jupyter lab` command 
and open the exercise notebooks to start coding.
You can also use `jupyter notebook` for a simpler interface.

## Other information

All exercises should be runnable on your own computer. In case you want to use the computer pools,
