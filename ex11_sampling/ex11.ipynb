You can create an anisotropic gaussian object `scipy.stats.multivariate_normal` and then use its function `pdf(x)` to get the probability density at point `x`. Note that here the probability $p(x)$ is given, however for the Metropolis algorithm an unnormalized function $f(x) = p(x) / Z$ with an unknown normalization constant $Z$ would work as well. This is one of the advantages of the algorithm as $Z$ can be hard or impossible to compute depending on the distribution.\n",

You could then also evaluate the [Kullback-Leibler divergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_normal_distribution#Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence) between the original gaussian and the gaussian estimated from the samples.\n"
